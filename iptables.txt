IPv4 packet filtering and NAT
=============================
- Manages the IPv4 packet filter _rule tables_ in the _Linux kernel_.
- Each table consists of a number of built-in _chains_ and user-defined _chains_.
- Each chain is a _list of rules_ which can match a set of packets.
- Each _rule_ specifies what to do (the action to take) with a packet that matches.
- This action is called a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain
_in the same table_.

Rule Tables
  List of Chains
    List of Rules
      Rule: Specifies the TARGET (the action to take) with a matching package.

RULE
====
- Defines what kinds of packets match this rule.
- What to do with a matching packet (the TARGET).

  If a packet does not match, the next rule in the chain is examined.
  If a packet matches, the next rule is specified by the value of the TARGET.
The value of the target can be:
  1. The name of a user-defined chain.
  2. One of the `iptables-extensions' TARGETs.
  3. One of ACCEPT, DROP or RETURN.

ACCEPT: Let the packet through.
DROP: Don't let the packet through.
RETURN: Stop traversing this chain in the rule table and resume at the next
rule in the previous (calling) chain.

If the end of a built-in chain is reached
OR
A rule in a built in chain with target RETURN is matched, the target specified
by the _chain policy_ determines the fate of the packet.

There are currently 5 independent tables. Which tables are present at any time
depends on the kernel configuration options and which kernel modules are present.

The 5 rule tables are:
 - filter
 - nat
 - mingle
 - raw
 - security

  The _built-in chains_ in _tables_ represent the _netfilter hooks_ which trigger
them. Chains determine _when_ the rules will be evaluated.

  The names of the built-in chains mirror the names of the _netfilter hooks_
they are associated with:
  PREROUTING: Triggered by the NF_IP_PRE_ROUTING hook.
  INPUT: Triggered by the NF_IP_LOCAL_IN hook.
  FORWARD: Triggered by the NF_IP_FORWARD hook.
  OUTPUT: Triggered by the NF_IP_LOCAL_OUT hook.
  POSTROUTING: Triggered by the NF_IP_POST_ROUTING hook.
