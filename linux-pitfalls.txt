- If you get a weird error (that is, an error whose cause is not obvious at the
  first look) while running a command, then the cause is _most probably_ about
  insufficient permissions. Some of the examples to insufficient permissions
  might be:
  - The user who is trying to run the command does not have read, write or
    execute permissions on the directory.
  - The file system on which the file being manipulated by the command might be
    read only.
    A nice example to this is to try to target a host with read-only file
    systems using Ansible. The error given by Ansible will not be very obvious
at the first look (although you will realize that it gives you hints about
permissions if you read carefully).
