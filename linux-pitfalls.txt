- If you get a weird error (that is, an error whose cause is not obvious at the
  first look) while running a command, then the cause is _most probably_ about
  insufficient permissions. Some of the examples to insufficient permissions
  might be:
  - The user who is trying to run the command does not have read, write or
    execute permissions on the directory.
  - The file system on which the file being manipulated by the command might be
    read only.
