1. What is the difference between a subshelling a command and regular execution
of a command?

2. Is the only difference between executing something normally, vs executing
something in a subshell that when you execute something in a subshell, shell
variables (as well as environment variables) are copied to the process as
well?
  If that's the case, then there is no benefit in executing something other
than a shell script in a subshell right? Because it is not possible to
access to shell variables from something other than a shell. Or, is it the case
that only actually it does not make sense to subshell something other than a
shell script?

3. Is it possible to alter the environment variables of a process from outside
of that process?

4. How to check if a variable is a shell variable, or an environment variable?
