1. Executing a shell script from another shell script _does not_ mean that the
inner script is being executed in a _subshell_. This action (that is, executing
a shell script from another shell script) is no different than executing, say,
a Python command from the outer shell script.
    The only way something (a command that is a shell script or a command that
is something other (such as Python script, a binary, etc.)) gets executed in a
subshell is to put the command between
(command args)
or
$(command args)
    The former form executes the command in a subshell and sends the output
wherever its destination was (usually the STDOUT and STDERR).
    The latter form executes the command in a subshell and captures the output
of the command into a string.
