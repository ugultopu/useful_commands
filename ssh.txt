 As you know, everything in UNIX is user based. That is, every activity
performed on a UNIX system is associated with a user. SSH is no exception to
this.

 When you SSH to a machine, you always SSH as a user. If you don't explicitly
specify the user, SSH command assumes the username on the local system. For
example, if your username is "a_username" and if you SSH as:
    ssh 192.168.1.1
this is equivalent to:
    ssh a_username@192.168.1.1

 Now, there are two important files in every user's home directory. These are:
    ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ~/.ssh/id_rsa

 The former (~/.ssh/authorized_keys) is used when someone SSH'es to this
machine as this user. The remote person presents a private key while SSH'ing,
and if there is a public key in "~/.ssh/authorized_keys" (on the machine on
which the SSH server runs) that corresponds to this private key, the remote
user is granted access.

 The latter (~/.ssh/id_rsa) is the private key of the user. It is used when
SSH'ing to a remote machine which runs an SSH daemon (that is, 'sshd'). The
local user presents this private key to the remote SSH server, and the SSH
server checks if the user that is being SSH'ed to has specified the public
key part of this private key in "~/.ssh/authorized_keys" file. If yes,
access is granted to the remote user.
